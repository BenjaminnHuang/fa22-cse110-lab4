4. It will return a array of discounted(50% off) prices [100, 200, 150]. The function goes through every price in prices array and calculate the discounted prices and put it back to the resulting array.
5. Error. Since i is a let variable, meaning, it cannot be accessed outside of the if block scope, it's not defined at line 12.
6. Error. Since discountPrice is a let variable, meaning, it cannot be accessed outside of if block scope, it's not defined at line 13.

    A. '32'. 2 maps to its string representation '2'.
    B. 1. String '3' maps to its integer representation 3.
    C. 3. null maps to its integer representation 0.
    D. '3'. null maps to its string representation 'null' 
    E. 4. true maps to its integer representation 1.
    F. 0. false maps to its integer representation 0 and null maps to its integer representation 0.
    G. '3undefined'. undefined maps to its string representation 'undefined'.
    H. NaN. This is an error, so the whole thing becomes NaN.
14. 
    A. true. '2' maps to its integer representation 2, and 2 is greater than 1.
    B. false. Dicationary comparison, first char '2' is greater than first char '1'.
    C. true. '2' maps to its integer representation and 2 equals to 2.
    D. false. '2' and 2 are not the same without type conversion.
    E. false. true maps to its integer representation 1, and 1 is not equal 2.
    F. true. Boolean(2) returns true, so true eqauls to true.
15. == check whether two variables are the same AFTER their conversions. So '2' == 2 is true.
    === check whether two variables are the same WITHOUT conversions. So '2' === 2 is false.
